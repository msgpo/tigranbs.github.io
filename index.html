              I'm a <code>software engineer</code> with a deep focus on software <i>optimization and scalability</i>.
              <br/> Worked for companies like <b>JetBrains, PicsArt, AdValidation, CodinGame, RightScale</b> etc..

              I started my career as a backend software engineer in 2008.
              Then quickly moved to Web UI projects by making jQuery plugins and custom Wordpress and Drupal themes as an Upwork freelancer.<br/>
              Proudly served to the army from 2010 to 2012 without any computer, that's why I read more books during those 2 years than all in my life.<br/>
              Then after the army, I started my professional career as a lead backend developer at IFC Markets, leading Forex trading company.
              I learned a lot there and saw how multi-country business operates, and how deep technological optimizations can bring real business value.<br/>
              That's why I focused myself on workflow optimizations.

              I love riding a motorcycle especially for a long distance trips. One time I made a large motorcycle trip across Europe from Estonia to France Lion, it took 1.5 month and it was
              life changing event for me. <br/>
              I alow skiing a lot during winter season, so as you can imagine, I riding a motorcycle when there is no snow, and skiing when it's snowing :)

              I founded my first company in 2014 which was a skill testing software specifically targeted for banking industry. I developed it solo within 3 months, then started to sell it,
              by knocking doors of local financial institutions in Yerevan, Armenia. After 1 year of hard working I got 3 paid customers, but model wasn't working very well, so I decided to move on.
              I open sourced full platform under TestedBrain name in Github, and after a few months one of the russian companies wanted full licence on it and few months consulting for them, so I made a deal!
              Later on I fully focused on consulting companies and optimizing their software workflows, infrastructure. Founded few companies later on, and had 2 company exists.

              It is funny but I founded local fruit and vegetables delivery company <a href="https://gazar.am" target="_blank">Gazar.am</a> where my focus was optimizing delivery flow,
              and building platform on top of that, but after having huge success on local market, we got good deal on selling a company, so we moved forward on that.
